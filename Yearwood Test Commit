# FSW16-Git-Intro
This is for FSW 16 to learn how to git.

Hooray! I think I did it right.

I am Karen L. Yearwood.

Three words that describe me: determined, funny, creative.

I have a cat, but I love all animals, big and small, hairy or scaly.

I love origami.  I also make jewelry.

I really proud of myself for working this out!
